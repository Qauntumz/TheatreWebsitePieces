# TheatreWebsitePieces
Pieces from live website project for local portland theatre company.
This was part of the live project for the end of the C# and .Net course at the tech academy. Worked with a team of 6 other developers to create
a working website for a local theatre company.  I very much enjoyed working on this project and this is just the beginning, the files in this folder are snippets of some of the code that I wrote for the project.
